## Lab Color Space
Explain the Lab color space and its significance in your project.

The Lab color space is a perceptually uniform color space that separates color information into three channels: L* (lightness), a* (green to red), and b* (blue to yellow). In this project, the Lab color space was utilized for [specific purpose, e.g., color analysis, segmentation, etc.]. The normalization of Lab values to the range [0, 1] allowed for [explain any specific advantages or considerations].
